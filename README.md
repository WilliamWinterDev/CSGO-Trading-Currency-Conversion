# CSGO-Trading-Currency-Conversion
A small chrome extension to convert various CSGO marketplaces into GBP by default.

## Supported exchanges

| Exchange | Supported Currencies |
| --- | --- |
| [BitSkins (referral link)](bskn.co/?ref_alias=eRYbqhGsw_U) | GBP, EUR, USD (default) |
| [CSGO Float](https://csgofloat.com/) | GBP, EUR, USD (default) |
| [Buff](https://buff.163.com/) | GBP, EUR (default), USD |

### Why is this useful?

Most of the CSGO exchanges by default are in USD / EUR with no way to convert that to GBP easily, this extension saves a lot of time by having to go between convertors to see if you're getting a good deal, since this uses a standardized convertor the results will always be the same.
